        <h2>Kirtipur - Hidden Gem Waiting for Its Spotlight</h2>
        <p>
          Alright, let’s talk about Kirtipur. It’s this stunning little town
          perched on a hilltop just southwest of Kathmandu, full of history,
          culture, and charm. But despite being one of Nepal’s most historically
          significant places, it’s often overshadowed by its more famous
          neighbors like Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur. It’s been on UNESCO’s
          tentative list since 2008, but let’s be real—not much has been done to
          push it towards an official World Heritage status. And that? That’s
          kinda frustrating. A Glimpse into Kirtipur’s History

        <h2>Khokana – Where Dashain Isn’t Celebrated!</h2>
        <p>
          Tucked away just south of Kathmandu, Khokana is one of Nepal’s most
          unique and historically rich villages. But here’s the twist—while the
          rest of the country comes alive with celebrations during Dashain,
          Nepal’s biggest festival, Khokana remains eerily quiet. That’s
          right—Dashain isn’t celebrated here. Instead of the usual kite flying,
          tika ceremonies, and goat sacrifices, the village follows a
          centuries-old tradition of not observing Dashain at all. But why?
          We’ll get to that. Beyond this fascinating tradition, Khokana is famou
